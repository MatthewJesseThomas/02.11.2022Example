        <p>The Book of Revelation is the final book of the New Testament. Its title is derived from the first word of the Koine Greek text: apokalypsis, meaning "unveiling" or "revelation". The Book of Revelation is the only apocalyptic book in the New Testament canon. It occupies a central place in Christian eschatology.

        Revelation 1:7 says, “Behold, He comes with clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and they also which pierced Him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him. Even so, Amen.It stands to reason that when seeing the Lord come with clouds, everyone will welcome His coming with great joy, but why is it said that “all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him”?”

        It says in Matthew 24:6–8: “And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.”
